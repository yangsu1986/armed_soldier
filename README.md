no idea on rebase. if at first there is a local repo, then a repo is created on github, I don't know how to push the local to github repo. here is an instruction, https://www.cnblogs.com/secondwatch/p/7805080.html. I tried but no idea on rebasing. finally successed but don't know why and what is the correct steps.

combined changes from local dev and origin master.
